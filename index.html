        <p>Hello! I am currently a Business Analytics student at Northwood University, driven by a passion for transforming data into actionable insights. I’m skilled in tools like Python, SQL, and various analytics software, and I’m always eager to tackle complex problems with creative, data-driven solutions. With hands-on experience in data visualization, statistical analysis, and business intelligence, I strive to bridge the gap between raw data and strategic decision-making. My goal is to create impactful solutions that drive success for businesses and help them navigate today’s data-rich landscape.
